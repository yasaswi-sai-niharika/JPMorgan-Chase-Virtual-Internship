The JP Morgan Virtual Online Internship included completing a three-part module focused on setting up our workstation so as to enable its interfacing with the relevant financial data feed, make the required calculations and then present this in a way that allows the traders to visualize and analyze this data in real-time.

In-depth information regarding software engineering course:
-Module 1: Interfacing the relevant financial (stock price) data feed and making the necessary adjustments to facilitate the monitoring of potential trade opportunities was the goal of the first module. Python was used in an REPL environment to assist with this development and a git patch file was created for the same.

-Module 2: The objective of this task was to fix the client-side web application so that it displays a graph that automatically updates as it gets data from the server application. Implementation of the Perspective(JPMorgan Chase Framework and tool) open source code in preparation for data visualization was done and again a git patch file was created.

-Module 3: Perspective(JPMorgan Chase Framework and tool) was used to generate a live graph that displays the data feed in a clear and visually appealing way for traders to monitor this trading strategy. Modification of the typescript files in the repository to make the web application behave in an expected manner and then the generation of a patch file of the changes made was done.
